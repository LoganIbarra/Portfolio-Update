                        <p>Cooking With Roux is an Alexa Skill that allows users to find and cook recipes through voice navigation only. Due to time limitations, sample dialogues contain features that weren't a part of the final script. This project exhibits my ability to work with limited information, testing and iterating to make progress. The skill combines my interests in research, design, and cooking, all in one place.</p>

                    <p><i>Assumptions - Due to time limitations, assumptions were made for the following:</i></p>
                    <ul class="note">
                        <li>Users of the app would be for the creation of a persona, Morgan</li>

                        <li>General user needs prior to interviews</li>
                    </ul>
                    
                    <p>I established my user persona, Morgan, and my system persona, Roux, to reference throughout the project.</p>

                    <p>User needs and stories were defined, focusing on primary functionalities someone like Morgan might need during daily interactions with Roux. Some examples of user needs and stories were:</p>
                    
                    <div class="list_box">
                        <p>Provide recipes for breakfast, lunch, dinner, and snacks:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>As a busy professional, I want to search for simple breakfast recipes on the weekend to maximize my free time.</li>
                            <li>As a user, I want to find recipes that can be utilized for meal prep or leftovers for lunches so I can save time getting ready in the morning.</li>
                            <li>As the user Morgan, I want to find new dinner recipes to prepare; so I don’t fall back on the same meals after a long day.</li>
                            <li>When I am driving home from work, I want dinner recipe options so I can stop by the store and grab ingredients if necessary.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </div>
                    
                    <div class="list_box">
                        <p>Use the recipe while cooking:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>While preparing my meal, I want ingredients listed in groupings so that I don’t get overwhelmed or have to listen to long lists of items.</li>
                            <li>As the user Morgan, I want instructions provided in a sequential, efficient fashion to feel confident I’m doing things correctly.</li>
                            <li>As a user, I want the option to repeat any instructions if I need clarification or don’t hear it properly.</li>
                            <li>While multitasking, I want to be the one to push the instructions forward so I can prepare the meal at my own pace.</li>
                            <li>As a user, I want clear, descriptive instructions where I can easily understand what I’m trying to achieve.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </div>
                    
                    <p>I then wrote sample dialogues between our user and the system persona Roux. The sample dialogues would help me consider future design choices and necessary functionalities.</p>
                    
                    <div class="list_box">
                        <p>As a busy professional, I want to search for simple breakfast recipes on the weekend to maximize my free time.</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>U: Recommend a brakfast recipe.</li>
                            <li>S: Certainly! We can prepare a tuna frittata, a hearty egg dish with potatoes and dollops of sour cream baked in. Cook time is 25 minutes. How does this sound?</li>
                            <li>U: Can you recommend something faster?</li>
                            <li>S: Of course. I have a recipe for avocado toast, topped with a fried egg and sprouts. Cook time is 10 minutes. Say ‘Get Started’ or ‘More Options.’</li>
                            <li>U: Get started.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </div>
                    
                    <div class="list_box">

                        <ul>
                            <li>S: Step two, add diced potatoes to the heated pan with olive oil and cook until they start to brown.</li>
                            <li>U: (Alt 1) Repeat.</li>
                            <li>U: (Alt 2) Repeat that.</li>
                            <li>U: (Alt 3) Repeat step two.</li>
                            <li>S: Step two, add diced potatoes to the heated pan with olive oil and cook until they start to brown.</li>
                            <li class="none">The user completes the step and is ready to proceed.</li>
                            <li>U: (Alt 1) Next.</li>
                            <li>U: (Alt 2) Next step.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </div>
                    
                    <p>Expanding on my sample dialogues, I considered what a complete experience between our user Morgan and Roux might look like with multiple requests.</p>
                    
                    <figure>

                    <p>Using this, I established a user flow for Cooking With Roux. <a href="images/roux/userflow.pdf" target="_blank">View the user flow here</a>.</p>
                    
                    <p>With the user flow, I wrote a script including utterances and prompts that I would transfer to the Alexa Developer Console. I further iterated on this using proactive information strategies and tapered prompts.</p>

                    <h2>User Testing</h2>
                    
                    <p>I set up a Wizard of Oz usability test and recruited participants. The participant would communicate with me directly, and I would respond to them as Roux within the confines of the voice script written. I wrote a test plan and established objectives.</p>

                            <p>What are commonly used utterances when trying to find a new recipe?</p>
                            <p>Does the participant experience any pain points when trying to find a recipe?</p>
                            <p>Observe reactions/interactions with the system persona name.</p>

                            <p>Five (5) moderated in-person “Wizard of Oz” style usability tests that included a short briefing, tasks, and a debriefing.</p>
                            <p>Participants measured the ease of each task using the single ease 7-point rating scale.</p>

                    <p>I compiled audio transcripts and synthesized the data into an affinity map. <a href="images/roux/affinitymap.pdf" target="_blank">View the affinity map here</a>.</p>
                    
                    <p>Using the affinity map, I created a rainbow spreadsheet to assist with pinpointing areas for improvement. <a href="images/roux/rainbow.pdf" target="_blank">You can view the rainbow spreadsheet here</a>.</p>
                    
                    <p>Based on the testing results, I added utterances for more polite wording such as "may I," provided instructions for handling compound ingredient requests, and error instruction that keeps users progressing.</p>

                    <h2>Reflect</h2>
                    
                    <p>This project familiarized me with voice interface design principles and developing for systems such as Alexa. If I had more time, I would have preferred to research the user's needs and speaking styles instead of making assumptions. It was a positive experience to make decisions to progress and investigate through testing shortly after.</p>
