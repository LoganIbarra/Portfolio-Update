                    </div>
                    <p>Designed an Alexa skill that allowed users to find and cook recipes with voice navigation only.</p>
                    <p><i>Considerations:</i> Some features were written into sample dialogues that were not written as part of the final scripts due to time limitations.</p>
                    <p><i>Assumptions - Due to time limitations, assumptions were made for the following:</i></p>
                    <ul class="note">
                        <li>Users of the app would be for the creation of a persona, Morgan</li>
                        <li>Speaking style of users for the creation of the system persona, Roux</li>
                        <li>General user needs prior to interviews</li>

                    <h2>Define</h2>
                    <p>I first established both my user persona, Morgan and my system persona, Roux to reference throughout the project.</p>

                    <p>User needs and stories were defined, focusing on key functionalities someone like Morgan might need during daily interactions with Roux. Some examples of user needs and stories were:</p>
                    
                    <div class="list_box">
                        <p>Provide recipes for breakfast, lunch, dinner, and snacks:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>As a busy professional, I want to search for simple breakfast recipes on the weekend so I can maximize my free time</li>
                            <li>As a user, I want to find recipes that can be utilized for meal prep or leftovers for lunches so I can save time getting ready in the morning</li>
                            <li>As Morgan, I want to find new dinner recipes to prepare so I don’t keep falling back to my same, easy meals after a long day</li>
                            <li>When I am driving home from work, I want to be provided dinner recipe options so I can stop by the store and grab ingredients if necessary</li>
                        </ul>
                    </div>
                    
                    <div class="list_box">
                        <p>Use the recipe while cooking:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>While preparing my meal, I want ingredients listed to me in groupings so that I don’t get overwhelmed or have to listen to long lists of items</li>
                            <li>As Morgan, I want instructions provided in a sequential, efficient fashion so that I feel confident I’m doing things correctly</li>
                            <li>As a user, I want the option to repeat any instructions in the event I need clarification or don’t hear it properly</li>
                            <li>As a person who is multitasking, I want to be the one to push the instructions forward when I’m ready so I can prepare the meal at my own pace</li>
                            <li>As a user, I want clear, descriptive instructions so I can more easily understand what I’m trying to achieve</li>
                        </ul>
                    </div>
                    
                    <p>I then wrote sample dialogues between our user and the system persona Roux. This would help me consider future design choices and necessary functionalities. A selection of sample dialogues included:</p>
                    
                    <div class="list_box">
                        <p>As a busy professional, I want to search for simple breakfast recipes on the weekend so I can maximize my free time.</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>U: Recommend a recipe for breakfast.</li>
                            <li>S: Certainly! We can prepare a tuna frittata, a hearty egg dish with potatoes and dollops of sour cream baked in. Cook time is 25 minutes. How does this sound?</li>
                            <li>U: Can you recommend something faster?</li>
                            <li>S: Of course. I have a recipe for avocado toast, topped with a fried egg and sprouts. Cook time is 10 minutes. Say ‘Get Started’ or ‘More Options’.</li>
                            <li>U: Get started.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </div>
                    
                    <div class="list_box">
                        <p>As a user, I want the option to repeat any instructions in the event I need clarification or don’t hear it properly.<br><i>User is progressing through a recipe with the help of the assistant.</i></p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>S: Step two, add diced potatoes to heated pan with olive oil and cook until they start to brown.</li>
                            <li>U: (Alt 1) Repeat.</li>
                            <li>U: (Alt 2) Repeat that.</li>
                            <li>U: (Alt 3) Repeat step two.</li>
                            <li>S: Step two, add diced potatoes to heated pan with olive oil and cook until they start to brown.</li>
                            <li class="none">User completes step and is ready to proceed.</li>
                            <li>U: (Alt 1) Next.</li>
                            <li>U: (Alt 2) Next step.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </div>
                    
                    <p>Expanding on my sample dialogues, I considered what a full experience between our user Morgan and Roux might look like with multiple requests.</p>
                    
                    <figure>

                    <p>Using this, I established a user flow for Cooking With Roux. <a href="images/roux/userflow.pdf">View the user flow here</a>.</p>
                    
                    <p>With a full user flow, I wrote a script including utterances and prompts that could be used for the Alexa Developer Console. I further iterated on this using proactive information strategies and tapered prompts.</p>

                    <h2>User Testing</h2>
                    
                    <p>I set up a Wizard of Oz usability test and recruited participants. The participant would communicate with me directly and I would respond to them as Roux within the confines of the voice script written. I wrote a test plan and established objectives.</p>
                    
                    <div class="insight_list">
                        <div class="insight_list-item">
                            <p class="takeaway">Test Objectives</p>

                            <p>What utterances are commonly used when trying to find a new recipe?</p>
                            <p>Does the participant experience any pain points during the interaction of trying to find a recipe?</p>
                            <p>Observe participants’ reactions/interactions with the system persona name of "Roux".</p>
                        </div>
                        <div class="insight_list-item">
                            <p class="takeaway">Method</p>
                            <p>Five (5) moderated in-person “Wizard of Oz” style usability tests. Included a short briefing, tasks, and a debriefing.</p>
                            <p>Participants were asked to measure the ease of each task using the single ease 7-point rating scale.</p>
                        </div>                       
                    </div>
                    
                    <p>Audio transcripts were compiled and I synthesized the data into an affinity map. <a href="images/roux/affinitymap.pdf">View the affinity map here</a>.</p>
                    
                    <p>Using the affinity map, I created a rainbow spreadsheet to assist with pinpointing key areas for improvement. <a href="images/roux/rainbow.pdf">You can view the rainbow spreadsheet here</a>.</p>
                    
                    <p>I updated my voice scripts based on the testing results. This included adding utterances for more polite verbiage such a "may I", adding instructions for how to handle compound ingredient requests, and instructions for error handling that keeps users progressing.</p>

                    <p>This was a fantastic project to familiarize myself voice user interface design principles as well as developing for systems such as Alexa. If I had more time, I would have preferred to research the user needs and speaking styles as opposed to making assumptions. It was a good experience to move on decisions in order to progress and investigate through testing shortly thereafter.</p>
                    
                    <p>I'm very thankful for my mentor, Todd Chapin, who provided amazing guidance and support.</p>
